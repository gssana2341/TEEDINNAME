# 🚨 You're Using the WRONG Key!

## Problem Identified:
❌ **Current service role key is actually the ANON key**
❌ **Both keys have `"role":"anon"` - we need `"role":"service_role"`**

## 🔑 Get the CORRECT Service Role Key:

### In Your Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to **Settings** → **API** 
2. Look for **"Project API keys"** section
3. You should see TWO different keys:
   - `anon` / `public` key (what you currently have)
   - **`service_role` key** ← **THIS IS WHAT WE NEED**

### The correct service role key should:
- Be a DIFFERENT JWT token (longer and different)
- Have `"role":"service_role"` when decoded
- Give admin/elevated permissions

## 📱 Alternative: Create New Service Role Key
If you can't find it:
1. In Supabase Dashboard → **Settings** → **API**
2. Look for **"Generate new service role key"** or similar
3. Copy the new service role key

## 🔍 How to Verify the Key:
The service role key should look different and when you decode the JWT at https://jwt.io, you should see:
```json
{
  "role": "service_role"
}
```

Not:
```json
{
  "role": "anon"
}
```

## ⚡ Quick Fix:
Replace your current `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` with the actual service role key from your dashboard.
